# AutoGen Framework Repository 🚀

Welcome to the **AutoGen Learning Repository**! This repository is a space to explore and store code as you learn the **AutoGen** framework.

## 🌟 What is AutoGen?

**AutoGen** is an open-source framework that enables **collaborative workflows** using **multi-agent systems**. With AutoGen, you can create agents that communicate, process data, and perform tasks using:
- 🤖 **Language Models** (like Gemini,Mistral,Ollama)
- 🔧 **Code Executors**
- 🧑‍💻 **Human inputs**

AutoGen is **flexible** and **modular**, allowing you to build customized workflows that combine simple agents into powerful solutions!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install AutoGen via pip:

```bash
pip install autogen-agentchat~=0.2
```

Explore the code examples in this repository to get hands-on with AutoGen and learn how to create your own agent-driven applications!
